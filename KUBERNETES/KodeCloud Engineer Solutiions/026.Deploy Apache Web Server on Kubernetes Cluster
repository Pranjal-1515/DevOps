Q. There is an application that needs to be deployed on Kubernetes cluster under Apache web server. 
   The Nautilus application development team has asked the DevOps team to deploy it. We need to develop a template as per requirements mentioned below:
   Create a namespace named as httpd-namespace-nautilus.
   Create a deployment named as httpd-deployment-nautilus under newly created namespace. 
   For the deployment use httpd image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e httpd:latest, and make sure replica counts are 2.
   Create a service named as httpd-service-nautilus under same namespace to expose the deployment, nodePort should be 30004.

Sol. 1. Create namespace
            - kubectl create namespace httpd-namespace-nautilus
     2. Create a deployment manifest
              apiVersion: apps/v1
              kind: Deployment
              metadata:
                name: httpd-deployment-nautilus
                namespace: httpd-namespace-nautilus
              spec:
                  replicas: 2
                  selector:
                     matchLabels:
                         app: httpd
                     template:
                         metadata:
                              labels:
                                app: httpd
                         spec:
                            containers:
                            - name: httpd
                              image: httpd:latest
                              ports:
                              - containerPort: 80
      3. Create a service manifest
                apiVersion: v1
                kind: Service
                metadata:
                  name: httpd-service-nautilus
                  namespace: httpd-namespace-nautilus
                spec:
                    type: NodePort
                    selector:
                       app: httpd
                    ports:
                    - port: 80
                      targetPort: 80
                      nodePort: 30004
      4. Apply both deployment and service manifest
                - kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
                - kubectl apply -f service.yaml
