Q. One of the DevOps team member was trying to install a WordPress website on a LAMP stack which is essentially deployed on Kubernetes cluster. 
   It was working well and we could see the installation page a few hours ago. However something is messed up with the stack now due to a website went down. 
   Please look into the issue and fix it:
   FYI, deployment name is lamp-wp and its using a service named lamp-service. The Apache is using http default port and nodeport is 30008. 
   From the application logs it has been identified that application is facing some issues while connecting to the database in addition to other issues. 
   Additionally, there are some environment variables associated with the pods like MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE,  MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_HOST.
   Also do not try to delete/modify any other existing components like deployment name, service name, types, labels etc.

Sol. 1. Check all the pods and service running fine
            - kubectl get all
     2. Lamp service port is incorrect so correct it to 30008
            - kubectl edit svc <service-name>
     3. Get into pod and check the configuration
            - kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <container-name> /bin/bash
     4. Find the index.php and check the environment variables
            - cd /app
            - vi index.php
            - correct varibales name & save the file
            - service apache2 restart
            - curl http://localhost:80
     5. Now click on the app button on UI and check whether application is connected or not.
