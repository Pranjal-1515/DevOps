Q. A python app needed to be Dockerized, and then it needs to be deployed on App Server 1. We have already copied a requirements.txt file (having the app dependencies) 
   under /python_app/src/ directory on App Server 1. Further complete this task as per details mentioned below:
   Create a Dockerfile under /python_app directory:
   Use any python image as the base image.
   Install the dependencies using requirements.txt file.
   Expose the port 3003.
   Run the server.py script using CMD.
   Build an image named nautilus/python-app using this Dockerfile.
   Once image is built, create a container named pythonapp_nautilus:
   Map port 3003 of the container to the host port 8092.
   Once deployed, you can test the app using curl command on App Server 1.

Sol. 1. Connect to App_Server_1
           - ssh name@ip_App_Server_1
     2. Create the Docker File
           - sudo vi /python_app/Dockerfile
     3. Enter the content in the file.
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container
COPY src/requirements.txt .

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code into the container
COPY src/ .

# Expose port 3003
EXPOSE 3003

# Command to run the application
CMD ["python", "server.py"]

   4. Build the Docker Image
         - docker build -t nautilus/python-app .
   5. Run the Docker Container
         - docker run -d --name pythonapp_nautilus -p 8092:3003 nautilus/python-app
