Q. One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. 
   A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:
   a. Create an image ecommerce:datacenter on Application Server 1 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.

Sol. 1. Connect to App_Server_1
             - ssh name@ip_app_Server_1
     2. List running container to get the container id
             - docker commit CONTAINER_ID ecommerce:datacenter
     3. Check new image
             - docker images
