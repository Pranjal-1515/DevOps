Q. The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/cluster.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. 
   They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:
   Create a new branch xfusion in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. 
   Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

Sol.1. Connect to Storage_Server
        - ssh name@ip_storage_Server
    2. Navigate to the Repository Directory
        - cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster
    3. Create a New Branch
        - git checkout master
        - git pull origin master  # Ensure your local master is up to date
        - git checkout -b xfusion
    4. Copy the File
        - cp /tmp/index.html .
    5. Add and Commit the File
        - git add index.html
        - git commit -m "Add index.html to xfusion branch"
    6. Merge the Branch into Master
        - git checkout master
        - git merge xfusion
    7. Push Changes to Origin
        - git push origin master
        - git push origin xfusion
