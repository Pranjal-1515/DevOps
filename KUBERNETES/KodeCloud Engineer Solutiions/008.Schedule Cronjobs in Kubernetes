Q. The Nautilus DevOps team is setting up recurring tasks on different schedules. Currently, they're developing scripts to be executed periodically. 
   To kickstart the process, they're creating cron jobs in the Kubernetes cluster with placeholder commands. Follow the instructions below:
   Create a cronjob named nautilus.
   Set Its schedule to something like */7 * * * *. You can set any schedule for now.
   Name the container cron-nautilus. Utilize the httpd image with latest tag (specify as httpd:latest).
   Execute the dummy command echo Welcome to xfusioncorp!. Ensure the restart policy is OnFailure.

Sol. 1. Create cronjob.yaml manifest
            apiVersion: batch/v1
            kind: CronJob
            metadata:
              name: nautilus
            spec:
               schedule: "*/7 * * * *"  # Schedule to run every 7 minutes
               jobTemplate:
                  spec:
                     template:
                        spec:
                           containers:
                           - name: cron-nautilus
                             image: httpd:latest
                             command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Welcome to xfusioncorp!"]
                           restartPolicy: OnFailure
      2. kubectl apply -f cronjob.yaml
      3. kubectl get cronjob
