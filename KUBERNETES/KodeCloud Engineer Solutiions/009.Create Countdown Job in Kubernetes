Q. The Nautilus DevOps team is crafting jobs in the Kubernetes cluster. While they're developing actual scripts/commands, 
   they're currently setting up templates and testing jobs with dummy commands. Please create a job template as per details given below:
   Create a job named countdown-nautilus. The spec template should be named countdown-nautilus (under metadata), and the container should be named container-countdown-nautilus
   Utilize image debian with latest tag (ensure to specify as debian:latest), and set the restart policy to Never.
   Execute the command sleep 5.

Sol. 1. Create countdownjob.yaml manifest
            apiVersion: batch/v1
            kind: Job
            metadata:
              name: countdown-nautilus
            spec:
               template:
                 metadata:
                   name: countdown-nautilus
                 spec:
                     containers:
                     - name: container-countdown-nautilus
                       image: debian:latest
                       command: ["sleep", "5"]
                     restartPolicy: Never

      2. kubectl apply -f countdownjob.yaml
      3. kubectl get jobs
