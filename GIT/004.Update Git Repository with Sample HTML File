Q. The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. 
   One of the repo /opt/cluster.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp. 
   The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.
   Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos, add/commit the file and push to master branch.

Sol. 1. Copy index.html file from jump server to the storage server 
          - sudo scp /tmp/index.html  natasha@ststor01:/tmp
     2. Login on storage server  & Switch Root user
          - ssh natasha@ststor01
     3. Go to project repositories as per the task
          - cd   /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/
     4. Copy html file from tmp to repo 
          - cp /tmp/index.html  .
     5. Add and commit the index.html file
          - git add index.html
          - git commit -m "add index.html"
     6. Finally push master branch to the origin.
          - git push -u origin master
