Q. We need to deploy a Drupal application on Kubernetes cluster. The Nautilus application development team want to setup a fresh Drupal as they will do the installation on their own. 
   Below you can find the requirements, they have shared with us.
   1) Configure a persistent volume drupal-mysql-pv with hostPath = /drupal-mysql-data (/drupal-mysql-data directory already exists on the worker Node i.e jump host), 
      5Gi of storage and ReadWriteOnce access mode.
   2) Configure one PersistentVolumeClaim named drupal-mysql-pvc with storage request of 3Gi and ReadWriteOnce access mode.
   3) Create a deployment drupal-mysql with 1 replica, use mysql:5.7 image. Mount the claimed PVC at /var/lib/mysql.
   4) Create a deployment drupal with 1 replica and use drupal:8.6 image.
   4) Create a NodePort type service which should be named as drupal-service and nodePort should be 30095.
   5) Create a service drupal-mysql-service to expose mysql deployment on port 3306.
   6) Set rest of the configration for deployments, services, secrets etc as per your preferences. 
      At the end you should be able to access the Drupal installation page by clicking on App button.

Sol. Create a manifest for all objects

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: drupal-mysql-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: /drupal-mysql-data

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: drupal-mysql-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: drupal-mysql
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: drupal-mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: drupal-mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7
        env:
          - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
            value: root_password
          - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
            value: drupal
          - name: MYSQL_USER
            value: drupal_user
          - name: MYSQL_PASSWORD
            value: drupal_password
        volumeMounts:
          - mountPath: /var/lib/mysql
            name: mysql-storage
      volumes:
        - name: mysql-storage
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: drupal-mysql-pvc

---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: drupal
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: drupal
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: drupal
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: drupal
        image: drupal:8.6
        env:
          - name: DRUPAL_DB_HOST
            value: drupal-mysql-service
          - name: DRUPAL_DB_NAME
            value: drupal
          - name: DRUPAL_DB_USER
            value: drupal_user
          - name: DRUPAL_DB_PASSWORD
            value: drupal_password
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: drupal-mysql-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 3306
      targetPort: 3306
  selector:
    app: drupal-mysql

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: drupal-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
      nodePort: 30095
  selector:
    app: drupal

  2. Apply the object manifest
       - kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
