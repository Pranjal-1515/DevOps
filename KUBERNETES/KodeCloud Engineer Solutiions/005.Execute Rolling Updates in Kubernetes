Q. An application currently running on the Kubernetes cluster employs the nginx web server. 
   The Nautilus application development team has introduced some recent changes that need deployment. They've crafted an image nginx:1.17 with the latest updates.
   Execute a rolling update for this application, integrating the nginx:1.17 image. The deployment is named nginx-deployment.
   Ensure all pods are operational post-update.

Sol. 1. Check all the pods are running
           - kubectl get pods
     2. Check version of image deployed
           - kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
     3. Now edit deployment and then change the image to the required version
           - kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>
     4. Now scale down and up the replicas to restart the pods
           - kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=0
           - kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=3
     5. Now watch the pods
           - kubectl get pods -w
