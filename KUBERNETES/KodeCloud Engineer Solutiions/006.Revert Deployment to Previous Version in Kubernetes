Q. Earlier today, the Nautilus DevOps team deployed a new release for an application. 
   However, a customer has reported a bug related to this recent release. Consequently, the team aims to revert to the previous version.
   There exists a deployment named nginx-deployment; initiate a rollback to the previous revision.

Sol. 1. Check the current rollout history
           - kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
     2. Rollback to the previous version
           - kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
     3. Verify the rollback
           - kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
