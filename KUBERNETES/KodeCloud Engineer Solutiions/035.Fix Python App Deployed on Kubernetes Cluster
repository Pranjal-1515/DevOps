Q. One of the DevOps engineers was trying to deploy a python app on Kubernetes cluster. Unfortunately, due to some mis-configuration, 
   the application is not coming up. Please take a look into it and fix the issues. Application should be accessible on the specified nodePort.
   The deployment name is python-deployment-devops, its using poroko/flask-demo-appimage. The deployment and service of this app is already deployed.
   nodePort should be 32345 and targetPort should be python flask app's default port.

Sol. 1. Check the logs and describe the pod & service to find the issue.
           - kubectl logs <pod-name>
           - kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
           - kubectl describe svc <service-name>
     2. Edit the deployment to correct the image name & service to correct the target port.
           - kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>
           - kubectl edit svc <service-name>
     3. Restart the pods
           - kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=0
           - kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=1
