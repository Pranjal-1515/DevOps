Q. DevOps team created a new Git repository last week; however, as of now no team is using it. 
   The Nautilus application development team recently asked for a copy of that repo on Storage server in Stratos DC. Please clone the repo as per details shared below:
   The repo that needs to be cloned is /opt/official.git
   Clone this git repository under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory. Please do not try to make any changes in repo.

Sol. 1. Connect to Storage_Server
        - ssh name@ip_Storage_Server
     2. Move to the required directory 
        - cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos
     3. Clone repo
        - git clone /opt/official.git
