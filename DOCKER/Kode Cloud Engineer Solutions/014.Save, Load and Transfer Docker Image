Q. One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. 
   He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name games:nautilus. 
   Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. 
   So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.
   a. On App Server 1 save the image games:nautilus in an archive.
   b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.
   c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Sol. 1. Connect to App_Server_1
           - ssh name@ip_App_Server_1
     2. Save the Docker image as a tar archive
           - docker save -o /path/to/save/games_nautilus.tar games:nautilus
     3. Transfer the archive using
           - scp /path/to/save/games_nautilus.tar user@app_server_3_ip:/path/to/destination/
     4. Connect to App_Server_3
           - ssh name@ip_App_Server_3
     5. Load the Docker image from the archive
           - docker load -i /path/to/destination/games_nautilus.tar
