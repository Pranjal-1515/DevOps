Q. An application deployed on the Kubernetes cluster requires an update with new features developed by the Nautilus application development team. 
   The existing setup includes a deployment named nginx-deployment and a service named nginx-service. 
   Below are the necessary changes to be implemented without deleting the deployment and service:
   1.) Modify the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165
   2.) Change the replicas count from 1 to 5
   3.) Update the image from nginx:1.17 to nginx:latest

Sol. 1. Edit the deployment and change replicas from 1 to 5 and image tag to latest
         - kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>
     2. Now check all the replicas are up and running
         - kubectl get deployment
     3. Edit the service and change the nodeport
         - kubectl edit service <service-name>
