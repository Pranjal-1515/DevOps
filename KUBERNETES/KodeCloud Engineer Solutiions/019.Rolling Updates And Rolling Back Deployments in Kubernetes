Q. There is a production deployment planned for next week. The Nautilus DevOps team wants to test the deployment update and rollback on 
   Dev environment first so that they can identify the risks in advance. Below you can find more details about the plan they want to execute.
   Create a namespace datacenter. Create a deployment called httpd-deploy under this new namespace, 
   It should have one container called httpd, use httpd:2.4.27 image and 4 replicas. The deployment should use RollingUpdate strategy 
   with maxSurge=1, and maxUnavailable=2. Also create a NodePort type service named httpd-service and expose the deployment on nodePort: 30008.
   Now upgrade the deployment to version httpd:2.4.43 using a rolling update.
   Finally, once all pods are updated undo the recent update and roll back to the previous/original version.

Sol. 1. Create namespace
          - kubectl create namespace datacenter
     2. Create deployment manifest
            apiVersion: apps/v1
            kind: Deployment
            metadata:
              name: httpd-deploy
              namespace: datacenter
            spec:
               replicas: 4
               selector:
                 matchLabels:
                    app: httpd
               strategy:
                  type: RollingUpdate
                  rollingUpdate:
                      maxSurge: 1
                      maxUnavailable: 2
               template:
                   metadata:
                     labels:
                        app: httpd
                   spec:
                       containers:
                         - name: httpd
                           image: httpd:2.4.27
                           ports:
                           - containerPort: 80
      3. Apply deployment manifest
               - kubectl apply -f httpd-deployment.yaml
      4. Create a service manifest
                 apiVersion: v1
                 kind: Service
                 metadata:
                    name: httpd-service
                    namespace: datacenter
                 spec:
                    type: NodePort
                    selector:
                      app: httpd
                    ports:
                    - protocol: TCP
                      port: 80
                      targetPort: 80
                      nodePort: 30008
       5. Apply service manifest
                - kubectl apply -f httpd-service.yaml
       6. Update the image
                - kubectl set image deployment/httpd-deploy httpd=httpd:2.4.43 -n datacenter
       7. Undo the rollout
                - kubectl rollout undo deployment/httpd-deploy -n datacenter
