Q. Some of the Nautilus team developers are developing a static website and they want to deploy it on Kubernetes cluster. 
   They want it to be highly available and scalable. Therefore, based on the requirements, the DevOps team has decided to create a deployment for it with multiple replicas. 
   Below you can find more details about it:
   Create a deployment using nginx image with latest tag only and remember to mention the tag i.e nginx:latest. Name it as nginx-deployment. 
   The container should be named as nginx-container, also make sure replica counts are 3.
   Create a NodePort type service named nginx-service. The nodePort should be 30011.

Sol. 1. Create deployment manifest
            apiVersion: apps/v1
            kind: Deployment
            metadata:
               name: nginx-deployment
            spec:
               replicas: 3
               selector:
                  matchLabels:
                    app: nginx
               template:
                  metadata:
                    labels:
                      app: nginx
                  spec:
                     containers:
                     - name: nginx-container
                       image: nginx:latest
      2. Create Sevice manifest
               apiVersion: v1
               kind: Service
               metadata:
                   name: nginx-service
               spec:
                  type: NodePort
                  selector:
                     app: nginx
                  ports:
                   - protocol: TCP
                     port: 80
                     targetPort: 80
                     nodePort: 30011
      3. Apply Deployment and service manifest
                - kubectl apply -f <deployment-file>
                - kubectl apply -f <service-file>
