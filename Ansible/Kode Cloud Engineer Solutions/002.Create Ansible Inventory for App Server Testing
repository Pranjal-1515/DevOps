Q. The Nautilus DevOps team is testing Ansible playbooks on various servers within their stack. They've placed some playbooks under /home/thor/playbook/ directory on the jump host and now intend to test them on app server 1 in Stratos DC.
   However, an inventory file needs creation for Ansible to connect to the respective app. Here are the requirements: 
   a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host. 
   b. Include App Server 1 in this inventory along with necessary variables for proper functionality. 
   c. Ensure the inventory hostname corresponds to the server name as per the wiki, for example stapp01 for app server 1 in Stratos DC.
Sol. 1. Go to playbook directory and create inventory file
        - cd /home/thor/playbook
        - vi inventory
     2. Add the entry for stapp01
        - [app_servers]
          stapp01 ansible_host=<AppServer1_IP_or_Hostname> ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=<password>
     3. Verify
        - ansible -i inventory stapp01 -m ping
