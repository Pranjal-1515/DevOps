Q. A junior DevOps team member encountered difficulties deploying a stack on the Kubernetes cluster. The pod fails to start, presenting errors. 
   Let's troubleshoot and rectify the issue promptly.There is a pod named webserver, and the container within it is named nginx-container, its utilizing the nginx:latest image.
   Additionally, there's a sidecar container named sidecar-container using the ubuntu:latest image.
   Identify and address the issue to ensure the pod is in the running state and the application is accessible.

Sol. 1. First we will describe the pod to check the issues in Pod.
       - kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
     2. After finding the issue we will edit the pod and correct it.
       - kubectl edit pod <pod-name>
     3. Now we will check the status of the pod.
       - kubectl get pods
