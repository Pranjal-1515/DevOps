Q. The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to host an application on a nginx-based container. There are number of tickets already been created for similar tasks. 
   One of the tickets has been assigned to set up a nginx container on Application Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. Please perform the task as per details mentioned below:
   a. Pull nginx:stable docker image on Application Server 1.
   b. Create a container named beta using the image you pulled.
   c. Map host port 3004 to container port 80. Please keep the container in running state.

Sol. 1. Connect to App_Server_1
           - ssh name@ip_App_Server_1
     2. Pull nginx image
           - docker pull nginx:stable
     3. Create and Run the Nginx Container
