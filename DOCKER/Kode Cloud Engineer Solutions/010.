Q. As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom images created for one of their projects. 
   Several of the initial testing requirements are already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile 
   (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 1 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with the following requirements:
   a. Use ubuntu as the base image.
   b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 6400 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc).

Sol. 1. Connect to App_Server_1
           - ssh tony@ip_app_server_1
     2. Create a Dockerfile
           - sudo vi /opt/docker/Dockerfile
     3. Write Dockerfile
           - FROM ubuntu:latest
             RUN apt-get update && \
                 apt-get install -y apache2 && \
                 apt-get clean
             EXPOSE 6400
             RUN echo "Listen 6400" >> /etc/apache2/ports.conf
             CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
      4. Build the image
           - docker build -t apache2 .
      5. Run docker container
           - docker run -d -p 6400:6400 apache2
