Q. An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details:
   Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html.
   Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.

Sol. 1. Login to the App Server 1
           - ssh username@ip
     2. Check whether container is running or not if not start it
           - docker ps
           - docker start nautilus
     3. Verify volume mapping
           - docker inspect nautilus
     4. Verify port mapping
           - docker port nautilus
     5. Test application with curl
           - curl http://localhost:8080/
